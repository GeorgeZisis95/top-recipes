### Cursor 
For this website, I create a custom cursor using the `mousemove` event on Javascript. 

The cursor consists of a dot surrounded by an outline border that follows the dot around. 

The cursor is animated to move smoothly through the page.

The cursor changes color based on the color of the text that goes behind it.

The cursor size scales depending on the element it currently is "touching".

### Main Page

The body consists of the header, the main page and the footer.

The main page layout changes based on the button the user clicks. Home contains four buttons, each leading to a different recipe. The layout is responsive and the buttons look good in any screen size.

I also added animations when hovering over the different page elements to make the webpage feel more alive.

### Recipe Layout

I start things off with a button taking the user back to the main page. The height is automatic making this button subtle. 

Secondly, the title of the recipe is followed by a small desciption. Both are centered to give the user a cool introduction to the page. 

I use a numbered list for the instruction and I animate each instruction on hover by scaling and tranlating the text slightly to the right.

For the ingredients I use a box filled with a tomato color to make them stand out. I also float this box to make the text of the instructions go around it when the width changes. This makes the page feel more dynamic.
